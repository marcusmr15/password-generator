# Password Generator

## Description

This webpage generates either a random 16-character password (that includes lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols) OR a password based on specific criteria set by the user. Both of these scenarios require the user to input a response via prompts so they can decide what type of password best fits their needs.
